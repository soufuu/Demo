This repository contains the code for the first application
in chapter 5 of "Enterprise Android" from Wrox Press.

== Configuring the endpoint

Before starting the project, edit the Java file below:

$CODE/restfulCachingProviderContacts/com/enterpriseandroid/restfulcontacts/ContactsApplication.java

and edit the following variables:

    private static final String PROTOCOL = HTTP;
    private static final String HOST = EMULATOR_HOST_IP;
    private static final String PORT = TEST_PORT;
    private static final String SERVICE = SPRING_SERVICE;

to set the host and service against which you want to run the REST
client.

Of course, the default variable settings will work for a local
instance of the springContactService. You probably dont need to change
these variables.

== Running the application
This project was tested on an ARM emulator for a Galaxy Nexus device,
running Android API Level 15, Ice Cream Sandwich, with a gig of memory.
It should run, as well, on most any device, API Level 14 or greater.

This application depends on the remote service in project springService
Contacts that supports the REST protocol described in chapters 5 and 6.
This application depends on a running instance of that project.

== Development
This project was developed with Eclipse Juno on OS X 10.6.8 and ADK
version 22.0.1.  It should be portable to other development environments.

== Building with Eclipse
In order to build this project, using eclipse, you will, first, have to
copy the necessary project files into the project root directory
The needed file are:
tools/ide/eclipse/project => .project
tools/ide/eclispe/classpath => .classpath
tools/project.properties => project.properties

There are several ways to do this:

=== By hand
Go for it!

=== From Windows Explorer:
Navigate to this directory (e.g., C:\Users\[user-name]\ea-examples\restfulCachingProviderContacts\tools)
 and double click the file "setup.bat"

It seems that Explorer will not change the name of a file so that
it begins with a period (.), so dragging and renaming may not work.

=== From a Windows CMD prompt:
Navigate to the project tools directory and use the setup.bat file
The user "blake" might, for instance, do this:
C:\Users\blake\ea-examples\restfulCachingProviderContacts>cd tools
C:\Users\blake\ea-examples\restfulCachingProviderContacts\tools>setup.bat

=== From a *NIX shell prompt
$ cd tools
$ . setup.sh

=== Using ant
$ ant -f tools/eclipse.xml

Once the project has been set up, from eclipse:

Import... >> General >> Existing Projects into Workspace

Note that "Import >> Android >> Existing Android Code into Workspace"
is something else entirely.  It may work, but if you use it you are
on your own.

Occasionally, eclipse gets confused about the version of the Java compiler
to use on a newly imported project.  If you see messages about the compiler
compliance level, try using Properties >> Java Compiler to change the
"Compiler compliance level" to anything other than its current value.
"Apply" the change, and then change it again, to 1.6

== Building with Ant

These instructions assume a *NIX shell prompt.  If you are using
 Windows CMD you will have to adapt them appropriately.

To build this project with ant, you need two files;

local.properties
build.xml

Both of these files can be generated using the "android" tool
(assuming you have put the directory $ANDROID_HOME/sdk/tools onto your $PATH)

$ android update project --path .

There is also a build.xml file in ./tools which should be identical
to the one produced by the command above, except that it contains
the "eclipse" target, which sets this project up for eclipse.
